# PlanetChatBot

A semi-functional chatbot that can give data back on the planets in our solar system! The chatbot is still learning :)

[The bot recieves data from this API:](https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/)

The Bot is build with Chatterbot and integrates with SQLite as its database. 

The frontend uses Streamlit and the API is called with the requests library.
